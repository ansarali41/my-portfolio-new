This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Hey there! I'm Ansar, a software engineer with a passion for turning complex ideas into elegant code. My journey started at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, where I fell in love with technology and problem-solving. From my first steps as a front-end intern at Net Art India to my current role as a back-end software engineer at Amharc Tech, I've been on an incredible adventure of growth and learning.

The MERN stack is my playground, and JavaScript is my language of choice. But more than just writing code, I love crafting solutions that make a real difference. Whether I'm working remotely or on-site, I bring creativity, adaptability, and a genuine excitement for technology to everything I do. Each project is a new challenge, and I'm always eager to learn, improve, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech trends, participating in coding challenges, or dreaming up the next big software solution. Want to collaborate or just chat about tech? I'm all ears!
